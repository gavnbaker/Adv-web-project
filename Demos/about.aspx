        <p class="auto-style1">
            For my Advance Web Development course, the project that I will be undergoing is the creation of a website that sells baked goods. This bakery will give the customer the choice of selecting a pastry, whatever decorations that they would like to have on that pastry, along with the amount that they would like to order. The customer will also have the obtion of choosing a delivery date, and pick up time.</p>
        <p class="auto-style1">
            As the the project grows I would like to have a login page, that will allow me to keep track of a registered user. With that being said I would also have a database to keep track of these users, along with their previous orders that they have made.
